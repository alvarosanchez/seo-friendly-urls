SEO Friendly URL's Grails Plugin
================================

This is a simple Grails plugin which helps to easily convert any string into a SEO-friendly one, eg, from `"The Lord of the Rings"` to `"the-lord-of-the-rings"`.

Useful if you want SEO-friendly URL's like /book/the-lord-of-the-rings instead of /book/show/123.
